# 📱 Spam SMS Detection

## 🚀 Task Objectives

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. This task demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and deployment readiness.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `SpamSMS_Detection.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the development process.
- `src/spam_detector.py`: Modularized Python code for the main logic.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `spam_sms_dataset.csv`: Dataset used for training/testing (if applicable).
